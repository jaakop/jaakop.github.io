                                During my mandatory military service in The Finnish Defence Forces I served in the
                                virtual instruction unit in Kainuu Brigade for 9 months.
                                I was the senior of the unit and managed our four person unit under our captain's
                                leadership
                            </p>

                                Main responsibility of the unit was to help and guide in virtual training of other
                                conscripts in Bohemia Simulation's Virtual BattleSpace 3 (VBS 3)
                                and SAAB's Ground Combat Indoor Trainer (GCIT). The unit was also tasked with the
                                maintenance and upkeep of these simulators and their training scenarios.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along side our main tasks I developed and maintained the unit's web-based class
                                management software and managed the class rooms.
                            </p>

                                During the service I worked with a national team of virtual training units in
                                collaboration in the projects of the unit where I managed our unit's projects as well as
                                many cross unit projects.

                                compete in various vocational skills.

                                In 2021 I competed in Web development under Gradia vocational school where I achieved
                                <b>1st place</b>.
                            </p>
                            <p>The web development tasks in the final were to design and develop a computer management
                                website for Opinsys.
                                Over two days, first we had to develop the front-end with our chosen technologies. I
                                used only jQuery on top of plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                                On the second day we had to develop a backend for the website where I chose to use PHP.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The comleted websites were judged on desing, technical implementation, accordance with
                                web standards and other features of the site. <br>

                                Defend the tree of life from deforestation! This game is about defending the Finnish
                                tree of
                                life, Iso Tammi, from modern deforestation by using its large network of roots to sprout
                                new
                                trees and make them attack the lumberjacks.

                            <p>Developed at Finnish Game Jam 2023 Jyväskylä, Iso Tammi is a tower defense game where
                                your
                                task is to defend the large oak from Finnish Mythology.
                                The game was developed in <b>Unity 3D with C#</b> and modeled in Blender. The team was
                                divided into programmers (me and Lauri) and a 3D artist (Atte) with the rest of the
                                roles
                                filled as needed by everyone on the team. </p>
                            <h2>My role</h2>
                            <p>During the jam I worked on the gameplay systems such as enemies, spawning, trees and
                                attacking.</p>
                            <h3>Enemy spawning</h3>
                            <p>I implemented the enemy spawning in the GameController object in the scene. With these
                                controls the user could define a list of enemies that the game would spawn, how likely
                                they're to spawn, how often a new wave is created, how many enemies are in a wave and
                                how far away of the trees is the wave created.</p>

                                Enemy list is a list of structs which are marked serializable so they are able to be changed in the editor. This makes it very easy to add new enemies and balance the game by changing the likely hood of each enemy.

                            loading="lazy">
                            <p>Enemies by themselves were the easiest to create. The enemy script only controls the
                                enemy characteristics such as enemy speed and damage. The different types were
                                implemented with Unity prefabs where each enemy got their own characteristics and art
                            </p>
                            <p>The enemy script implements moving, attacking and getting damage. But most of these
                                actions are called from outside the script. By itself the script only turns the sprite
                                to look at the camera due to sprite implementation in a 3D enviroment. Moving is called
                                by gameController, which controls and keeps track of all of the enemies in the game. And
                                getting hit is called by the projectile, that hits the enemy.</p>
                            <h3>Trees</h3>
                            <h4>Tree types</h4>

                            <p>The game includes four types of spawnable trees and the Iso Tammi itself. Each tree can
                                attack with projectiles at the enemy, which can be sped up by pressing *space* when the
                                tree is selected, with their unique projectiles.</p>
                            <p>The tree script is similiar to the enemy script that all of the trees use the same
                                script, but with different serialized values. In these values you can speciefy the
                                projectile used, and attack paramters. Trees are spawned by the game controller when
                                player clicks a spot with a tree card selected. Trees eventually die when they've
                                received enough damage from the enemies.</p>

                            <p>Each tree has its unique projectile of which each has it's own strength</p>
                            <p>I impleneted these projectiles with inheritance, the spruce and pine projectiles being
                                the base class since they didn't have any special effects other than speed and damage.
                                The others had unique behavior e.i. exploding, hanging around and splitting to multiple
                                projectiles on hit. For these special effect I could just override behavior of the base
                                class for exmaple the acorn that explodes on hit.</p>
