                            <p>For my vocational degree in computer programming (2018-2021) I had to do a project using
                                technologies taught in
                                the program: C# , WinForms and MSSQL. So I chose to develop a map tool to be used in DnD
                                and
                                other games.</p>
                            <h2>Design</h2>
                            <p>The goal was to have two modes of the tool the level editor tool and the game master
                                tool. With the level editor
                                tool the user could create levels with 2D Tilemaps. After creating the maps for a game
                                night the user would
                                launch the game master tool. In this tool the user could render the maps on a separate
                                screen and keep notes for
                                themselves about the game session for future reference.</p>

                                only tiles with an image are
                                saved and all other are removed as for each saved tile the coordinates are saved with
                                the image details so that the

                                other. With this the user
                                can create complex sceneries with simple tilemaps.</p>

                            <p>Due to the limited size of the grid that can be shown at a time, the editor draws a

                                to be able to have a clearer image of the whole map. This is done by selecting a tile
                                for an coordinate from the
                                highest layer, that has an image. Then the image is scaled to 1 pixel size and placed on
                                to the minimap.</p>

                            <p>Tilemaps are 2D images that consist of drawn tiles of specified width and height. This
                                image can be then parsed into
                                seperate tiles, from which a level can be built from.
                                When adding a tilemap the editor asks for the path of the image and the size of the
                                tiles. After this information is
                                given the image is seperated into tile buttons. When clicking a tile it becomes selected
                                and can then be placed onto
                                the level. These tile buttons are implemented with WinForm buttons.

                            <p>Long Laugh the King is a card game developed for the Finnish Game Jam 2024 in Kajaani.
                                The goal of the game is to form jokes from cards to make the king laugh so that he
                                doesn't get displeased with you. The game was developed with Godot with a team of 5. In
                                the team Me and Lauri were programming, Atte and Leo were doing art and Saarni was
                                responsible for the sounds of the game.</p>
                            <h2>My Role</h2>
                            <p>As programmers me and Lauri decided to try and learn to use Godot during this game jam.
                                Since we didn't know the engine that well at the start we didn't have clear
                                responsibilities. But at the end of the project the biggest systems I had done for the
                                game were the logic for point system and random events. Including how the cards are
                                counted and how the custom effects affect the points received.</p>
                            <h3>Cards</h3>
                            <img src="./images/LLTK1.png" alt="Iso Tammi gameplay image" height="200px" loading="lazy">
                            <p>The idea for the card system was to have three types of cards: Theme, Subject and
                                Punchline, represented by red, blue and green cards respectively. By combining the cards
                                in the right order the player would've created a complete joke. By combining specific
                                cards with each other the joke would be funnier or more offensive to the king.</p>
                            <h4>Challenge</h4>
                            <p>The biggest challenge implementing this system was how to handle the card relationships
                                to each other. By having ~30 cards all with relations to others, the assignment and
                                management of these cards in the time frame of the game jam would've been extremely
                                difficult.</p>
                            <p>To ease this I implemented a system to read the relationships out of a csv file. This
                                enabled us to use an existing system, like Excel, to assign and manage the relations
                                ships easily.</p>
                            <img src="./images/LLTK3.png" alt="Iso Tammi gameplay image" height="200px" loading="lazy">
                            <p>Close to the end of the jam we were even able to balance the game by adjusting these
                                relations in the csv file, since it was so trivial.</p>
                            <h3>Random Events</h3>
                            <img src="./images/LLTK2.png" alt="Iso Tammi gameplay image" height="200px" loading="lazy">
                            <p>At the end of the jam I challenged my self to implement random events into the game. The
                                events would include a random character visiting the king's court and affecting how much
                                points each card could give.</p>
                            <p>I was doubtful I would be able to complete this system in time for the game jam deadline,
                                as none of our systems were implemented to support this. But at the end of the day I
                                managed to squeeze it in!</p>

                            <p>Slug Wars is the debut game of Hovi Production. It's a thid person online multiplayer
                                game developed in Unity. The team consisted of 8 core members and several contractors
                                and freelancer providing development and assets to the game. The game had development
                                time of ~1 year.</p>
                            <h2>My Role</h2>
                            <p>During the games development I worked in the role of <b>Programming Team Lead</b> which
                                consisted of leading a 5 person programming team, multiplayer programming, architecture,
                                CI/CD, implementing Agile -working methods as well as coding practices and reviews to
                                the team</p>
                            <h3>Programming</h3>
                            <p>In the project I developed multiple key systems into the game. Among these are the
                                shooting system, effects system and several power up that can be found in the game. </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to gameplay systems I developed analytics for the game using Unity Analytics
                                -service, allowing the team to monitor the game in beta testing and analyse player
                                behavior in the game and adapt accordingly
                            </p>

                            <p>I also helped refactor the code base allowing for the system to be expanded as the game
                                grew out of its original game design into somethign greater. With these refactoring I
                                enabled the team to develop the game more quickly and more easily than before.
                                The refactoring also improved the games preformance on the computer and over the network
                                in a measurable amount.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Team lead</h3>
                            <p>
                                In the development of the game I leveraged the previous professional experience I had as
                                a programmer and took on the leadership position in the team.
                                In this position I helped other programmers and guided them in the development of the
                                game as well as planned the programming side of the games development and divided the
                                tasks to the other programmers.

                            <p>
                                Having worked in Agile teams before I saw a great opportunity to bring the team to the
                                Agile methodology. This was done through internal training and introduction of industry
                                standard tools like <b>Jira</b>.
                                The team adopted Agile well and it improved the project management and team
                                communication during the development. With Jira we were able to track issues and
                                features better and faster, allowing us to release Beta builds quickly.
                            </p>
                            <h3>CI/CD</h3>
                            <p>When we released Slug Wars to open beta on itch.io I saw an opportunity to implement
                                CI/CD pipeline for the game to allow us to have faster releases. Previously the game was
                                build and released by hand, which was slow and prone to error.
                                To fix this I implemented a CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions to build and release the
                                game automatically to itch.io
                            </p>

                                loading="lazy">
                            <p>The pipeline was set to generate development build every Sunday, for quick testing, and a
                                release build for every git tag to make sure that there was always a stable build
                                available for a player.
                                After building the cache, the pipeline took ~10 minutes as a whole and it was used 47
                                times over the development of the game.</p>

                            <p>Wrapped is a game about packing packages with bubble wrap made for the Finnish Game Jam
                                2025 with the theme of bubbles.
                                The game was made with a 3 person team in 48h in the Godot game engine, where I was a
                                programmer
                            </p>
                            <h2>My Role</h2>
                            <p>Me and Lauri divided the programming between the two of us for this game. During the jam
                                I developed the main menu, day change menu, the different types of items and the logic
                                for the boxes</p>
                            <h3>Items</h3>
                            <p>During the jam I developed the item spawning and implemented all of the items into the
                                game. In total we managed to make 8 different types of items into the game</p>
                            <img src="./images/WrappedItems.png" alt="Different items of Wrapped. A lamp, melon, fish, book, mug, gpu, plant and a vase" height="200px"
                                loading="lazy">
                            <p>One of the reasons we were able to have so many items was the system that could
                                effortlesly handle any types of items. This made it also possible to make interesting
                                items, such as the fish that flops around on the table</p>
                            <h3>Main menu</h3>
                            <p>With the robust item system we had in place I was able to quickly develop a Main Menu
                                that thaught the player quickly the main mechanic of the game by making the buttons
                                draggable objects that had to be placed into the box</p>
                            <img src="./images/WrappedMainMenu.png" alt="Main menu of wrapped with the start button hovering over the box" height="200px"

                            <h3>World</h3>
                            <p>I was also able to design the world and lighting for the game using the 3D assets made by
                                Atte. With the design, lighting and assets we were able to achieve a polished look for
                                the game in such a short time.
                                Below is a video of the games evolution during the jam</p>

                                Defend the tree of life from deforestation! This game is about defending the Finnish
                                tree of
                                life, Iso Tammi, from modern deforestation by using its large network of roots to sprout
                                new
                                trees and make them attack the lumberjacks.

                            <p>Developed at Finnish Game Jam 2023 Jyväskylä, Iso Tammi is a tower defense game where
                                your
                                task is to defend the large oak from Finnish Mythology.
                                The game was developed in <b>Unity 3D with C#</b> and modeled in Blender. The team was
                                divided into programmers (me and Lauri) and a 3D artist (Atte) with the rest of the
                                roles
                                filled as needed by everyone on the team. </p>

                            <p>I implemented the enemy spawning in the GameController object in the scene. With these
                                controls the user could define a list of enemies that the game would spawn, how likely
                                they're to spawn, how often a new wave is created, how many enemies are in a wave and
                                how far away of the trees is the wave created.</p>

                                Enemy list is a list of structs which are marked serializable so they are able to be
                                changed in the editor. This makes it very easy to add new enemies and balance the game
                                by changing the likely hood of each enemy.

                            <p>Enemies by themselves were the easiest to create. The enemy script only controls the
                                enemy characteristics such as enemy speed and damage. The different types were
                                implemented with Unity prefabs where each enemy got their own characteristics and art
                            </p>
                            <p>The enemy script implements moving, attacking and getting damage. But most of these
                                actions are called from outside the script. By itself the script only turns the sprite
                                to look at the camera due to sprite implementation in a 3D environment. Moving is called
                                by gameController, which controls and keeps track of all of the enemies in the game. And
                                getting hit is called by the projectile, that hits the enemy.</p>
                            <h3>Trees</h3>
                            <h4>Tree types</h4>

                            <p>The game includes four types of spawnable trees and the Iso Tammi itself. Each tree can
                                attack with projectiles at the enemy, which can be sped up by pressing *space* when the
                                tree is selected, with their unique projectiles.</p>
                            <p>The tree script is similar to the enemy script that all of the trees use the same
                                script, but with different serialized values. In these values you can specify the
                                projectile used, and attack parameters. Trees are spawned by the game controller when
                                player clicks a spot with a tree card selected. Trees eventually die when they've
                                received enough damage from the enemies.</p>

                            <p>I implemented these projectiles with inheritance, the spruce and pine projectiles being
                                the base class since they didn't have any special effects other than speed and damage.
                                The others had unique behavior e.i. exploding, hanging around and splitting to multiple
                                projectiles on hit. For these special effect I could just override behavior of the base
                                class for example the acorn that explodes on hit.</p>

                                During my mandatory military service in The Finnish Defence Forces I served in the
                                virtual instruction unit in Kainuu Brigade for 9 months.
                                I was the senior of the unit and managed our four person unit under our captain's
                                leadership
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Main responsibility of the unit was to help and guide in virtual training of other
                                conscripts in Bohemia Simulation's Virtual BattleSpace 3 (VBS 3)
                                and SAAB's Ground Combat Indoor Trainer (GCIT). The unit was also tasked with the
                                maintenance and upkeep of these simulators and their training scenarios.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along side our main tasks I developed and maintained the unit's web-based class
                                management software and managed the class rooms.
                            </p>

                                During the service I worked with a national team of virtual training units in
                                collaboration in the projects of the unit where I managed our unit's projects as well as
                                many cross unit projects.

                                In the end of the service I trained new conscripts to our unit and I was a co-trainer in
                                nation wide virtual instructor support training organized by Armoured Brigade of Finnish

                                In 2021 I competed in Web development under Gradia vocational school where I achieved
                                <b>1st place</b>.
                            </p>
                            <p>The web development tasks in the final were to design and develop a computer management
                                website for Opinsys.
                                Over two days, first we had to develop the front-end with our chosen technologies. I
                                used only jQuery on top of plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                                On the second day we had to develop a backend for the website where I chose to use PHP.

                                The comleted websites were judged on desing, technical implementation, accordance with
