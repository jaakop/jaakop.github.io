                                During my mandatory military service in The Finnish Defence Forces I served in the
                                virtual instruction unit in Kainuu Brigade for 9 months.
                                I was the senior of the unit and managed our four person unit under our captain's
                                leadership
                            </p>

                                Main responsibility of the unit was to help and guide in virtual training of other
                                conscripts in Bohemia Simulation's Virtual BattleSpace 3 (VBS 3)
                                and SAAB's Ground Combat Indoor Trainer (GCIT). The unit was also tasked with the
                                maintenance and upkeep of these simulators and their training scenarios.
                            </p>

                                Along side our main tasks I developed and maintained the unit's web-based class
                                management software and managed the class rooms.

                                During the service I worked with a national team of virtual training units in
                                collaboration in the projects of the unit where I managed our unit's projects as well as
                                many cross unit projects.

                                In 2021 I competed in Web development under Gradia vocational school where I achieved

                            <p>The web development tasks in the final were to design and develop a computer management
                                website for Opinsys.
                                Over two days, first we had to develop the front-end with our chosen technologies. I
                                used only jQuery on top of plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                                On the second day we had to develop a backend for the website where I chose to use PHP.

                                The comleted websites were judged on desing, technical implementation, accordance with

                                the program: C# , WinForms and MSSQL. So I chose to develop a map tool to be used in DnD and

                            <h2>Design</h2>
                            <p>The goal was to have two modes of the tool the level editor tool and the game master tool. With the level editor
                                tool the user could create levels with 2D Tilemaps. After creating the maps for a game night the user would
                                launch the game master tool. In this tool the user could render the maps on a separate screen and keep notes for
                                themselves about the game session for future reference.</p>

                                highest layer, that has an image. Then the image is scaled to 1 pixel size and placed on to the minimap.</p>

                                seperate tiles, from which a level can be built from.
                                When adding a tilemap the editor asks for the path of the image and the size of the tiles. After this information is
                                given the image is seperated into tile buttons. When clicking a tile it becomes selected and can then be placed onto
                                the level. These tile buttons are implemented with WinForm buttons.

                                task is to defend the large oak from Finnish Mythology.
                                The game was developed in <b>Unity 3D with C#</b> and modeled in Blender. The team was
                                divided into programmers (me and Lauri) and a 3D artist (Atte) with the rest of the

                                they're to spawn, how often a new wave is created, how many enemies are in a wave and
                                how far away of the trees is the wave created.</p>

                            <p>Enemies by themselves were the easiest to create. The enemy script only controls the
                                enemy characteristics such as enemy speed and damage. The different types were
                                implemented with Unity prefabs where each enemy got their own characteristics and art

                            <p>The enemy script implements moving, attacking and getting damage. But most of these
                                actions are called from outside the script. By itself the script only turns the sprite
                                to look at the camera due to sprite implementation in a 3D enviroment. Moving is called
                                by gameController, which controls and keeps track of all of the enemies in the game. And
                                getting hit is called by the projectile, that hits the enemy.</p>

                            <p>The game includes four types of spawnable trees and the Iso Tammi itself. Each tree can
                                attack with projectiles at the enemy, which can be sped up by pressing *space* when the
                                tree is selected, with their unique projectiles.</p>
                            <p>The tree script is similiar to the enemy script that all of the trees use the same
                                script, but with different serialized values. In these values you can speciefy the
                                projectile used, and attack paramters. Trees are spawned by the game controller when
                                player clicks a spot with a tree card selected. Trees eventually die when they've
                                received enough damage from the enemies.</p>

                            <p>I impleneted these projectiles with inheritance, the spruce and pine projectiles being
                                the base class since they didn't have any special effects other than speed and damage.
                                The others had unique behavior e.i. exploding, hanging around and splitting to multiple
                                projectiles on hit. For these special effect I could just override behavior of the base
                                class for exmaple the acorn that explodes on hit.</p>
